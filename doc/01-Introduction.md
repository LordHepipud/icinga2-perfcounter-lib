Introduction
==============

What is this PowerShell module for? The idea was to create a basic module, providing an easy way to
work with Performance Counters on Windows Systems. This module can be used together with custom check
plugins designed for Icinga 2, to easily and without much complexity fetch Performance Counter data.

In addition this module allows an easy usage from the PowerShell itself, to quickly get an overview
of the current system beeing worked or a remote computer the module is installed on.

If you are ready to get started, take a look on the [installation guide](02-Installation.md).
